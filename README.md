# QuStoch: Quantum-Enhanced Stochastic Market Simulations

## Overview

Traditional stock market simulations rely on classical stochastic models like Monte Carlo methods, which, while effective, can be computationally intensive and limited in capturing the full range of market dynamics.

**QuStoch** leverages the power of **quantum superposition** to simulate multiple stochastic market states simultaneously. By integrating quantum algorithms into Brownian motion simulations, QuStoch offers a more efficient and probabilistically rich approach to financial modeling.

## Features

- **Quantum-Powered Simulations**  
  Harnesses quantum superposition to evaluate multiple stock price trajectories in parallel.

- **Enhanced Brownian Motion Modeling**  
  Encodes stochastic paths into qubits for a more representative market simulation.

- **Interactive Visualization**  
  Web-based dashboard that displays simulation results in real time.

## How It Works

Instead of iterating through all possible stock price movements like classical Monte Carlo simulations, **QuStoch** leverages quantum computing to represent many market states concurrently:

1. **Quantum Computation**  
   A quantum circuit encodes stochastic paths into qubits using **Hadamard** and **controlled rotation gates**.

2. **Classical Processing**  
   Quantum-generated results are processed using Python and calibrated against historical stock data.

3. **Web-Based Visualization**  
   The output is rendered dynamically in a Flask-based web dashboard with **JavaScript** and **Matplotlib**.
