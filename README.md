\section{Overview}
Traditional stock market simulations rely on classical stochastic models like Monte Carlo methods, which, while effective, can be computationally intensive and struggle to capture the full range of market dynamics. With advancements in quantum computing, we saw an opportunity to harness quantum superposition to simulate multiple stochastic states simultaneously.

\textbf{QuStoch} integrates quantum algorithms into Brownian motion simulations, offering a more efficient and probabilistically accurate approach to financial modeling.

\section{Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Quantum-Powered Simulations}: Uses quantum superposition to evaluate multiple stock price trajectories in parallel.
\item \textbf{Enhanced Brownian Motion Modeling}: Encodes stochastic paths into qubits for a more comprehensive market representation.
\item \textbf{Interactive Visualization}: A web-based dashboard displays simulation results in real time.
\end{itemize}

\section{How It Works}
Instead of iterating through possible stock price movements as in classical Monte Carlo simulations, QuStoch leverages quantum computing principles to represent multiple market states simultaneously:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Quantum Computation}: A quantum circuit encodes stochastic paths into qubits, utilizing Hadamard and controlled rotation gates to model stock price variations.
\item \textbf{Classical Processing}: The quantum-generated results are analyzed in Python, calibrated against historical stock trends, and processed for meaningful insights.
\item \textbf{Web-Based Visualization}: The output is presented in an interactive web application built with Flask, JavaScript, and Matplotlib for dynamic graphing.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Technologies Used}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Quantum Frameworks}: Quantum circuits for stochastic modeling.
\item \textbf{Python Backend}: Processes quantum-generated data and performs statistical analysis.
\item \textbf{Web Frontend}: Flask, HTML/CSS/JavaScript for user interaction.
\item \textbf{Data Visualization}: Matplotlib for graphing stock behavior.
\end{itemize}

\section{Challenges and Solutions}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Efficient Quantum Simulation}: Designing a practical quantum algorithm for Brownian motion required careful probability amplitude mapping.
\item \textbf{Quantum Noise \& Decoherence}: Implemented error mitigation strategies to enhance accuracy.
\item \textbf{Hybrid Integration}: Combined quantum-generated data with classical analytics for meaningful financial insights.
\end{itemize}

\section{Achievements}
We successfully built a prototype that demonstrates the potential of quantum computing in financial modeling. Key milestones include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Implementing a parallelized quantum approach to stochastic simulations.
\item Developing an interactive tool for real-time market analysis.
\item Optimizing our quantum circuit for execution on current NISQ devices.
\end{itemize}

\section{Key Learnings}
Through this project, we gained valuable insights into:
\begin{itemize}
\item The applications of quantum computing in finance, particularly in probabilistic modeling.
\item The challenges of designing quantum circuits for stochastic simulations.
\item The importance of hybrid quantum-classical models in practical applications.
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Plans}
We aim to further refine QuStoch with:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Improved Quantum Algorithms}: Enhancing accuracy and scalability with quantum error correction techniques.
\item \textbf{Exploring Alternative Models}: Investigating quantum walks for financial simulations.
\item \textbf{Expanded Web Features}: Adding real-time stock tracking and advanced analytics.
\end{itemize}

As quantum technology progresses, QuStoch has the potential to redefine financial forecasting by leveraging the efficiency of quantum computing.
